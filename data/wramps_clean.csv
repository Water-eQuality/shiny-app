Legacy Park,N/A,City of Malibu,Malibu Creek,Other - Detention,"The City constructed the Civic Center Stormwater Treatment Facility (SWTF) and Legacy Park, in 2006 and 2010 respectively, to divert drains in the Civic Center area that capture runoff from the 337-acre subwatershed (a portion of the Malibu Creek Watershed) that would otherwise discharge to lower Malibu Creek and Lagoon. Malibu Creek Watershed is about 80% undeveloped, with a land use mixture of 13% residential, 4% commercial, and 3% agricultural. Flows from runoff are detained in the 8-acre-foot pond in the park, then filtered and disinfected through ozonation by the SWTF for use in irrigation or to be circulated back to the detention pond. This has resulted in the diversion of all Los Angeles County and City MS4 drains that could otherwise potentially affect water quality at sampling sites at Surfrider Beach and adjacent areas. Because of this system, there is no discharge to lower Malibu Creek and Lagoon, except in extreme circumstances where treated flows exceed the capacity of the detention pond, which would generally occur during large back-to-back storm rain events that exceed the 85th percentile and when irrigation water cannot be used. Even then, only treated water would be discharged to the County box culvert and to the Creek. ",34.035356999999998,-118.68850500000001,N/A,2010-10-02T00:00:00Z,$35M,390000,"State, County, and Private Grants, Proposition Funding, Private Donations, and Municipal General Fund",15 ac,330 ac,N/A,7.9,8 ac-ft,NA,North Santa Monica Bay,34.035357,-118.688505,N/A,

This watershed is 78% undeveloped, with 2.3% high density residential development and 18.5% low density residential development focused in the bottom third of the watershed. Several years of data show that water discharging from the outlet of the facility (diverted and treated creek water at a privately-owned channelized portion of the creek) consistently exhibits testing results for FIB below or close to the laboratory method detection limits. The treatment facility has a total treatment capacity of 3,600 gpm for gross solids and sediment removal and up to 900 gpm capacity for disinfection. The treatment facility was designed to meet the WQOs set forth in the SMBB Bacteria TMDL for summer and winter dry weather, and wet weather periods for all but the wettest of rainfall years. Flow monitoring in the channel upstream of the facility in the first wet season post-construction showed that the facility has the capacity to treat all dry weather flows and most wet weather events, with highest flows peaking around 4,000 gpm with some isolated un-sustained peaks of 10,000 gpm or greater.",34.020555000000002,-118.786867,N/A,2010-06-28T00:00:00Z,"$1,089,395 ","$23,479 ","Proposition 40, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, City Match",0.02,"2,153 ac",N/A,3,3 ac-ft,NA,North Santa Monica Bay,34.020555,-118.786867,N/A,
